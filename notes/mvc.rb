MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a design pattern commonly used in web application development. Ruby on Rails is a web framework that follows the MVC pattern.

In Rails, the Model represents the application's data and the business logic that operates on that data. The View is responsible for rendering the user interface, and the Controller handles the interactions between the Model and the View.

When a user makes a request to a Rails application, the request is first routed to the appropriate Controller. The Controller then interacts with the Model to retrieve or modify data, and uses that data to render the appropriate View. The View is then sent back to the user's browser as an HTTP response.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of each component in the Rails MVC pattern:

Model: In Rails, Models are typically implemented as subclasses of ActiveRecord::Base, which provides a rich set of methods for working with a database. The Model is responsible for defining the structure and relationships of the data that the application uses. This includes defining the data schema, setting up associations between different Models, and defining validation rules to ensure data consistency.

View: In Rails, Views are typically implemented as templates that are rendered using a templating language like ERB or Haml. Views are responsible for presenting the data to the user in a format that can be understood. This includes formatting the data, and deciding which data to show or hide based on the user's needs.

Controller: In Rails, Controllers are typically implemented as subclasses of ActionController::Base, which provides a rich set of methods for handling HTTP requests. The Controller is responsible for receiving requests from the user, interacting with the Model to retrieve or modify data, and rendering the appropriate View. The Controller also handles things like authentication, authorization, and error handling.
